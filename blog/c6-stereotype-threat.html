  <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
  <h4>April 1, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog is focused on an anomaly called stereotype threat. Stereotype threat occurs when a subset of a group of people who are all evenly qualified underperform based on expectations.  For example, women might perform worse on math tests due to the stigma that men are better at math, even though they have just as much knowledge and are as well prepared.

    Personally I can't say that I've been affected by this, even though I am a woman who pursued a degree in a predominately male field.  I think this is mainly due to the circumstances in which I was raised, and the environment of the schools I attended.  I don't feel like anyone around me has ever mentioned that stereotype or encouraged it.  My only experience (and seeing my peers' experiences) with underperformance has been from not being prepared enough or test anxiety in general.  While I've certainly been nervous about failing, it's been more about my own insecurities rather than because I'm female.  In several articles I read, this wasn't the case with stereotype threat.  Instead, minority groups performed equally well on tests such as the SAT, but underperformed when told the test would judge them on their intelligence level.

    I think this issue can be mediated through changing the environments that students are exposed to.  Stereotypes exist due to people continuing to spread them and lumping people into categories. If school instead was focused on learning and each individual's potential and merit, we can remove the focus on students' gender/race/etc.

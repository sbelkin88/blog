  <h3>Feedback in DBC</h3>
  <h4>March 29, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    For our cultural blog this week we're asked to discuss our experience around pairing and feedback.  For someone not familiar with the term, pairing is the exercise of video chatting with another programmer as you work through a problem, and you both contribute to the code in a shared app.  For me, pairing has been both enjoyable and overwhelming so far.  I think that pairing is a great idea in Phase 0 as we are all working remotely so we can meet one another and ask questions if we get stuck.  I can also see other real-world benefits of it, for example if one person gets stuck, the pair can assist, or stopping one other from making the solution too complicated/going down rabbit holes.  On the other hand, I am very much an introvert.  I learn best by working through things in my head, and most of the time I prefer to solidify the concepts on my own.

    It's been tough for me to try and think out loud because I find it hard to keep track of things out loud.  For instance, when reading through the instructions out loud - I'm paying attention to reading them, instead of understanding what I'm supposed to do.  I find that I have to re-read the instructions in my head afterwards so I know where to go next.  I have also had the feeling of being overwhelmed to come up with an idea right away.  When you're sharing the code screen, sometimes I just want to sit and think about the problem for a minute, but my pair might want to actually play around with the code which makes things difficult sometimes.  I find myself wanting to copy the code all the time to a separate window so I can just think about the problem as it is on the screen. Overall I'm enthusiastic about the idea, but not sure if I'd want to be pairing in my job all day, every day.

    To switch gears and move onto the feedback portion, I think my experience has been a bit different.  I've been working at a job which requires daily communication both internally at my firm as well as externally with clients, so I think I have a good grip on being able to communicate while pairing and creating a positive environment to work in.  On that note, my feedback that I've received so far has been more about thinking out loud more rather than on how I interact with others. I do really value getting feedback in general though during this remote portion of the program as it gives us a good benchmark as to how far along we are comparatively and makes sure we're on par with the expectations of the course.

    I felt that writing feedback as specified for this program is a bit difficult as it should be specific without including details such as gender, and knowing it will be broadcasted and rated.  I'm definitely still working on providing helpful feedback in a kind manner to ensure that the message is coming across without inadvertently upsetting the other person.  I've also had some wonderful pairing sessions in which I struggled to come up with any actionable items.

    Overall I think both pairing and feedback are great learning tools in this program especially now when we are all remote.  The A.S.K. (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) concept of feedback is one of the things I love about DBC's culture as it promotes learning and growth, and I'm glad to be learning and adopting this mindset.

  <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
  <h4>March 29, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    When working with Ruby, methods are the basic code which tells the computer to do something.   This capability is great, but what happens when you are routinely running multiple methods, and can't easily find the code you need?  Classes are a functionality in Ruby which allows you to group all the methods that are applicable to certain types of objects.  You can then run an instance of the Class, and all the methods are there for you.  It saves time and confusion by bucketing them all together.  Let's run through an example: in finance, an asset manager needs to keep track of, and be able to quickly access, multiple data points relating to any one of their portfolios.  Let's build a class which will allow us to do that.  We first need to initialize the class by parsing in the portfolio's name and perhaps a short code for ease of reference, along with a date that you would want the output to be as-of:
    <pre>
    class PortfolioInfo

      def initialize (name, short_code, date)
      @name = name
      @short_code = short_code
      @date = date
      end

      #other code here to query underlying databases

    end
    </pre>
    Now we can write however many methods where the comments are which will take either the full portfolio name, or the short code, and use it to query underlying databases to gather information on the account as of the specified date - for example key metrics (P/E, Average Market Cap, Turnover), or generate a list of holdings as of that date. This saves us from having to write new methods every time we want to access a piece of data.  We can also run this for as many portfolios and dates as we want to.

    The information that we initially parse into the instance becomes what are called instance variables - they are defined at the top with the "@" sign in front of them, and this allows them to be used and referenced throughout the other methods you build within the class.

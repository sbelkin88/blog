  <h3>Values and Self-Affirmation</h3>
  <h4>April 9, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    **Disclaimer: this blog is based solely my opinion, and is not meant to discourage others' opinions**
  <p></p>
    The purpose of this week's cultural blog is to identify a few core values that are important to us and talk about how we can use self-affirmation with these values to help us succeed. To give a brief background on the topic, the practice of self-affirmation means that you identify values that are important to you and reflect on them in the face of adversity.  Several studies have shown that self-affirmation leads to a more favorable outcome - for example, performing better in school, and becoming healthier.  On the flip side of things, there are just as many studies which have been conducted and have not shown any differences due to self-affirmation. I think the process of identifying your underlying values, and reminding yourself of them, is an extremely positive practice, however I'm not convinced that this will be a life-changing solution.  I don't think self-affirmation is a magical cure that will improve your grades and make your skinnier.

    One thing that also stuck out to me in all the reading is that, throughout all the scientific studies that were done, self-affirmation is found to be non-effective in non-marginalized groups.  While being a woman puts me in a "marginalized group", I don't think self-affirmation will have an effect if you don't feel marginalized to start with.  As mentioned last week, I personally do not feel the stereotype threat that women are not as intelligent as men in math; therefore I doubt self-affirmation would do anything to improve my grades in math.  Not to say that this is a waste of an exercise, but my thinking leads me to the other end of the spectrum.  Instead of focusing on self-affirmation, should we not be focusing on ending the marginalization and stereotypes in the first place?

    I think that self-affirmation can be a great tool, especially as an interim solution.  However, I think a longer-term solution of more (and better) education and projects to eliminate the root cause would be more beneficial.  By promoting acceptance and having empathy for those around us, I think we can really change our society as a whole, which could considerably lessen the number of people who feel marginalized.  I'm not claiming to have all the answers, but in my opinion, repeating stereotypes only functions to sustain them.  By telling children there is a stereotype that boys will get better grades in math, I think you're perpetuating this and drawing attention to it, instead of encouraging them to be the best they can be, regardless of their gender.

    To get back to the topic at hand, some of the values that I find most important are: having a family, health, honesty, compassion, and persistence.  When you get down to it, our society has become more and more focused on material items and impressing others, when I think we should really be looking inwards and seeing if we are living the life we want and if we are being kind, empathetic individuals.  I don't think it means much if we're going about life just to earn money to afford fancy cars or houses if we hate our jobs and are unhappy day after day.  I'd rather be happy than be swimming in money.  In addition to being kinder to ourselves, I think our society needs to be turned around too and people need to start being kinder to each other, more accepting of other beliefs, cultures, and customs, and more empathetic of others' situations.

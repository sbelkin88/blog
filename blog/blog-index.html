  <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
  <h4>April 1, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog is focused on an anomaly called stereotype threat. Stereotype threat occurs when a subset of a group of people who are all evenly qualified underperform based on expectations.  For example, women might perform worse on math tests due to the stigma that men are better at math, even though they have just as much knowledge and are as well prepared.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Personally I can't say that I've been affected by this, even though I am a woman who pursued a degree in a predominately male field.  I think this is mainly due to the circumstances in which I was raised, and the environment of the schools I attended.  I don't feel like anyone around me has ever mentioned that stereotype or encouraged it.  My only experience (and seeing my peers' experiences) with underperformance has been from not being prepared enough or test anxiety in general.  While I've certainly been nervous about failing, it's been more about my own insecurities rather than because I'm female.  In several articles I read, this wasn't the case with stereotype threat.  Instead, minority groups performed equally well on tests such as the SAT, but underperformed when told the test would judge them on their intelligence level.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I think this issue can be mediated through changing the environments that students are exposed to.  Stereotypes exist due to people continuing to spread them and lumping people into categories. If school instead was focused on learning and each individual's potential and merit, we can remove the focus on students' gender/race/etc.

  <h3>Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas</h3>
  <h4>March 31, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas - does it sound like we're back in a Frat house in college yet?  As opposed to Greek letters, Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas are actually important tools that you can use in Ruby code.  They are essentially snippets of code which you tell the computer to do within a method.  We've already seen them when using enumerables, but here is an example:
    <pre>
    def method(arguments)
      arguments.each {|argument| do something to the argument}
    end
    </pre>
    The little bit in the curly brackets {} is what we call a Bloc.  Blocs function like a method in that they are telling the code to do something, but they are technically undefined and unnamed.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Procs are very similar to Blocs in that they also are bits of code which tell the computer to do something, however they are different in that they are defined and saved as a variable.  So you can take the exact same code as in our example above and define it as a variable which then can get passed into the method, instead of writing it out:
    <pre>
    proc = Proc.new {|argument| do something to the argument}

    def method(arguments)
      arguments.each(&proc)
    end
    </pre>
    The only difference here is that you use the "&" sign when you pull the Proc into your method.  These can be useful when you want to assign your Proc more than one thing to do, or if you want to refer back to it multiple times in your code.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Last, but not least, we have Lambdas.  Lambdas are rarely used, but they are the same thing as Procs, but are more detailed like methods.  The other main difference is that you can use the "return" keyword within a Lambda since it will only return the Lambda, not the entire method.  If you use "return" in a Bloc or a Proc, it will exit out of the entire method at the return.  The other main difference is that Lambdas will check the number of arguments passed into it (like methods), whereas Procs and Blocs do not.

  <h3>Feedback in DBC</h3>
  <h4>March 29, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    For our cultural blog this week we're asked to discuss our experience around pairing and feedback.  For someone not familiar with the term, pairing is the exercise of video chatting with another programmer as you work through a problem, and you both contribute to the code in a shared app.  For me, pairing has been both enjoyable and overwhelming so far.  I think that pairing is a great idea in Phase 0 as we are all working remotely so we can meet one another and ask questions if we get stuck.  I can also see other real-world benefits of it, for example if one person gets stuck, the pair can assist, or stopping one other from making the solution too complicated/going down rabbit holes.  On the other hand, I am very much an introvert.  I learn best by working through things in my head, and most of the time I prefer to solidify the concepts on my own.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    It's been tough for me to try and think out loud because I find it hard to keep track of things out loud.  For instance, when reading through the instructions out loud - I'm paying attention to reading them, instead of understanding what I'm supposed to do.  I find that I have to re-read the instructions in my head afterwards so I know where to go next.  I have also had the feeling of being overwhelmed to come up with an idea right away.  When you're sharing the code screen, sometimes I just want to sit and think about the problem for a minute, but my pair might want to actually play around with the code which makes things difficult sometimes.  I find myself wanting to copy the code all the time to a separate window so I can just think about the problem as it is on the screen. Overall I'm enthusiastic about the idea, but not sure if I'd want to be pairing in my job all day, every day.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To switch gears and move onto the feedback portion, I think my experience has been a bit different.  I've been working at a job which requires daily communication both internally at my firm as well as externally with clients, so I think I have a good grip on being able to communicate while pairing and creating a positive environment to work in.  On that note, my feedback that I've received so far has been more about thinking out loud more rather than on how I interact with others. I do really value getting feedback in general though during this remote portion of the program as it gives us a good benchmark as to how far along we are comparatively and makes sure we're on par with the expectations of the course.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I felt that writing feedback as specified for this program is a bit difficult as it should be specific without including details such as gender, and knowing it will be broadcasted and rated.  I'm definitely still working on providing helpful feedback in a kind manner to ensure that the message is coming across without inadvertently upsetting the other person.  I've also had some wonderful pairing sessions in which I struggled to come up with any actionable items.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Overall I think both pairing and feedback are great learning tools in this program especially now when we are all remote.  The A.S.K. (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) concept of feedback is one of the things I love about DBC's culture as it promotes learning and growth, and I'm glad to be learning and adopting this mindset.

  <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
  <h4>March 29, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    When working with Ruby, methods are the basic code which tells the computer to do something.   This capability is great, but what happens when you are routinely running multiple methods, and can't easily find the code you need?  Classes are a functionality in Ruby which allows you to group all the methods that are applicable to certain types of objects.  You can then run an instance of the Class, and all the methods are there for you.  It saves time and confusion by bucketing them all together.  Let's run through an example: in finance, an asset manager needs to keep track of, and be able to quickly access, multiple data points relating to any one of their portfolios.  Let's build a class which will allow us to do that.  We first need to initialize the class by parsing in the portfolio's name and perhaps a short code for ease of reference, along with a date that you would want the output to be as-of:
    <pre>
    class PortfolioInfo

      def initialize (name, short_code, date)
      @name = name
      @short_code = short_code
      @date = date
      end

      #other code here to query underlying databases

    end
    </pre>
    Now we can write however many methods where the comments are which will take either the full portfolio name, or the short code, and use it to query underlying databases to gather information on the account as of the specified date - for example key metrics (P/E, Average Market Cap, Turnover), or generate a list of holdings as of that date. This saves us from having to write new methods every time we want to access a piece of data.  We can also run this for as many portfolios and dates as we want to.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    The information that we initially parse into the instance becomes what are called instance variables - they are defined at the top with the "@" sign in front of them, and this allows them to be used and referenced throughout the other methods you build within the class.

  <h3>Tech Issues</h3>
  <h4>March 16, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    When I saw the topic for this week's cultural blog - "Issues in Tech" - I knew exactly what I wanted to research.  It's no secret that being a woman in tech is rare.  But why is this the case?  When I started out on this path to DBC, I received more than a few "why are you doing this?" and "what made you interested in programming?" questions.  It's difficult to answer these and be enthusiastic about this path when they're looking at you like you have three heads and have gone insane.  But is it really that "crazy" for a woman to want to switch industries and learn how to code?  Especially, as it turns out, a caucasian woman?  I'd like that answer to be no.  While I received great enthusiasm from friends who were already in the tech industry, the reactions were not the same from others.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    From doing some initial research, it seems there are several main issues surrounding women in tech: lack of early learning/exposure for young girls and teens, lack of women role models/mentors in the industry, and continuing sexism and harrassment during interviews and in the workplace.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Just as technology is a continually changing industry, I think that gender roles need to play catch-up and change along with it.  Throughout history women have had to continually fight for more and more rights, and I think unfortunately, the time has come for this fight to happen in technology.  This needs to start with the younger generation - if you don't start teaching younger girls about the tech world, no one will grow up to take our places. I can personally relate to this as I knew nothing about this industry until about two years ago (when I was 24!).  Programming/web-developing/entrepreneurship is something that should be introduced to kids back in middle school, and should be continued through college.  I feel that this is something that all kids could benefit from and would go a long way to introduce girls to the industry and teach them valuable skills early in life.  If this trend continues, we could exponentially increase the number of women pursuing degrees in tech fields and continuing into the industry after college.  If there were more of an equal gender balance in the industry, decisions like mine wouldn't be seen as being so strange.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This issue is a natural introduction to the next: the fact that there are so few mentors or women role models in the industry.  If you create a cycle of introducing young girls to technology, they will grow up to be mentors for the next generation.  The cycle has to start somewhere - why not have it start with us?  I feel a huge responsibility as a woman going into tech to give back, and do my part to be a mentor to other women.  I think we can be pivotal in implementing programs in the schools we grew up in and starting the trend.  When kids have a real-life role model to look up to, today's far-fetched idea becomes tomorrow's potential reality.  They will be able to see someone else accomplish it, and will have a path to follow in.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Last, but certainly not least, the culture of the tech industry needs a major facelift.  Companies need to realize that by encouraging and allowing sexism and harrassment to occur in their workplaces, they are hurting the entire community.  A crucial aspect of technology is that it's ever-growing and ever-changing, and we need to keep inventing and creating in order to keep that up.  Firms need to realize that the next biggest and best idea may (and very probably will) come from a woman, and they should want that woman on their team to develop it.  I think a big part of evolving in this space comes from the hiring process today.  Yes, I understand culture, and "fit", is a big part of whether you hire someone or not, but merit should play an equally large part.  Resumes should be evaluated on skill instead of the name at the top of the page, or the picture you find when you google said name.  Then bring the person in and see if they happen to be a cultural fit as well.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I think men in this industry have an equally large responsibility on their shoulders.  Create change in your own circles and companies.  Encourage your firm to hire great thinkers regardless of gender, and treat them with the same respect you show your male colleagues.  I believe the harrassment and condescending behavior needs to end, and we need a higher set of standards for ourselves.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I hope that my generation can succeed where past generations haven't, and that we can overcome the issues that women face in this industry.  I hope that we can put in the effort to invest in future generations and spark the trend that changes tech's culture. I know I will be doing my part. Will you do yours?

  <h3>Ruby Enumerables</h3>
  <h4>March 16, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Enumerables.  What the heck does that word even mean?  When first reading up on Enumerables, we were supposed to research certain Enumerable methods like <code>map</code>, <code>group_by</code>, and <code>cycle</code>.  However, when looking up <code>map</code> in the Ruby docs, I was directed towards the section on Arrays, which confused me even more.  Is map a method used on Arrays, or a method under Enumerables?  As it turns out, it's really both.  An Enumerable is simply a collection of methods which can be used to search or manipulate collections of data (therefore they can be used to search or manipulate Arrays as an example).  Therefore to break it down even further, <code>map</code> is a method belonging to a class of methods called Enumerables, which can be used on collections of data such as Arrays and Hashes.  Make sense?
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    There are a few different types of Enumerable methods which do different things:
    <ul>
      <li>Methods which don't actually touch the underlying data and just go through each item</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>each</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods that pull certain elements out of the underlying data based on criteria and populate a new collection with them</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>select</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods which change all underlying elements through a block and populate a new collection with them.  Note this does not alter the original collection.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>collect</code></li>
          <li><code>map</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods which actually change the original collection of data (are destructive). </li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>map!</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods which take a collection of underlying data and reduces it to a single value (i.e. adding up all elements). </li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>inject</code></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Getting a little off topic, the original purpose of this post was to discuss one Enumerable, of which I chose <code>map</code>. Map essentially creates a new collection of data (let's call it an Array going forward for ease), using all the original elements of an array, and changes them using a block.  The syntax looks like this:
    <pre>
      array.map {|element| element+2}
    </pre>
    What this says is take each element of the original array, add 2 to it, and populate the new value in a new array.  So if the original array was <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>, the new array would look like <code>[3,4,5,6,7]</code>. This is helpful as you can use this method either destructively (using <code>map!</code>), or non-destructively using <code>map</code>.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    <code>map</code> can also be used with Hashes, but you must include both the key and value in the code.  For example:
    <pre>
      hash.map {|key, value| value+2}
    </pre>

  <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
  <h4>March 14, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog focuses on our thinking styles.  After taking the short quiz (<a class="inline_link" href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">found here</a>), I was not surprised to find that I am a concrete sequential thinker.  Some of the things concrete sequential thinkers like are order, getting something right at the first attempt, and following precise, specific directions.  I can honestly say that my personality is in-line with this description 100%.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    In some ways, my thinking style has jived very well with Phase 0 of DBC.  We have very straightforward instructions, and a logical order to complete tasks in.  However, in other ways I have had to expand my work style.  For example, one thing that is difficult for concrete sequential thinkers to do is work in groups.  DBC is all about peer learning, and group work, which has been an adjustment for me.  I know that I prefer to work through problems and learn on my own and I have had to adjust my preferences in order to follow the curriculum.  I also know that I like to stay on task, which can be difficult if I'm pairing with someone who goes out of order, or can go off on a tangent.  While those discussions can sometimes be beneficial, part of me always wants to just continue with the task at hand.  I think that part of this process will be about me being flexible and open to other's insights and processes, and trying things in a different way.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    With that being said, I'm going into this process, and time in my life, with an open mind.  I know that I wasn't happy with the way things were before, and I think changing my mind-set can help with that.  I've always had a very fixed mindset (developed mainly I think from the culture I grew up in) - being afraid of failure, not taking risks, and believing that you're either the best or you're nothing.  Unfortunately I think many people my age, and from my hometown, would agree with this.  We were raised this way.  But it doesn't make it the right mindset, and I think we can all work on changing this to be better people.  By leaving my stable, well-paying job behind, and no set future, I am taking the biggest risk I ever have, in pursuit of finding meaning in my life and in my career.  I have realized that I'm not content sitting behind a desk doing nothing with my time in order to earn a hefty salary to afford nice things.  I'd rather be happy every day with less money, more knowledge, and a sense of fulfillment.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    So far in Phase 0 I am trying to catch myself whenever I fall back into a fixed mindset, and changing the way I'm viewing something.  For example, I was very nervous before the first guided pairing session.  In my mind, I didn't want to say or do something wrong because I didn't want to look stupid in front of others.  I also knew that we would be getting feedback from these sessions, and I wanted the best possible "grade".  Afterwards, I realized that I needed to take a step back from this, and understand that this is the time to take a risk and really internalize whatever feedback is given to me to improve upon myself.  I know I won't be graduating this program with a GPA tied to my name, or a class ranking, so I need to take this oppotunity to learn as much as I can, and grow as much as I can.

  <h3>Ruby Arrays and Hashes</h3>
  <h4>March 14, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    When I first started learning Ruby on Codecademy, before Phase 0, I thought Arrays and Hashes were two completely separate things.  Even as I read blog posts from DBC alumni about how they kept picking the wrong thing, I thought to myself, they're totally different, how could you get them confused?  Well, it makes a lot more sense now.  As it turns out, Arrays and Hashes in Ruby are very similar.  Both are ways of storing and indexing information. Both have keys and values.  And both grow as more information is added.  But there is one key difference: information in Arrays are organized using an integer as the key, whereas anything can be a key with Hashes (a string, float number, etc.)
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To take a step back, when you think of an index, such as one in a textbook, each key word or phrase is assigned to a page number where information can be found about it.  This is exactly how information is stored in both arrays and hashes.  An array is simply a collection of information organized in a logical sequence.  It looks something like this:
    <pre>
      array = [1,2,3,4,5]
    </pre>
    Each number within the brackets is indexed according to the position it's in.  So "1" is in the zero-eth position; its key is 0 and the value is 1.  "2" is in the first position; its key is 1 and the value is 2, and so on and so forth.  Once the array is created you can tell the computer to print the value by inputting the key.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    You can have an array full of other types of things, such as this:
  <pre>
    array_2 = ["Sam",2,"DBC",8.06]
  </pre>
    The basic construct of the key and value pairs still exists. If you ask the computer what value is stored in the key 3, the response will be 8.06.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Hashes on the other hand can have non-numeric keys.  As such you define both the key and the value.  For example:
  <pre>
    months{
      "January" => 1,
      "February" => 2,
      "March" => 3,
    }
  </pre>
    As you can see above, January is now a key and 1 is its value.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    In short, while arrays and hashes are very similar methods of storing information, there are definitely use cases for both, and it's important to consider the project you're working on, and the scope of the data, before deciding which method to use.

  <h3>CSS Technical Blog</h3>
  <h4>March 3, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Since week 2 had a reputation for being the most time-consuming, in true Sam-fashion I started on the challenges Friday night and worked through the weekend.  I have a fear about not being able to succeed at this, compunded by working at my job full-time still, so it's important to me to be as ahead of the ball as I can be.  I had started the HTML Codecademy course before Phase 0, but I had never heard of or touched CSS.  For someone who doesn't know either, you can think of HTML and CSS like a recipe.  The list of ingredients is the HTML code, whereas the instructions are like the CSS.  The CSS tells the browser what to do with your HTML, and how certain elements should blend together.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To be honest, after going through the tutorial, I felt much better about the whole language.  HTML didn't make too much sense on its own (just like a recipe is rendered useless if you only have the list of ingredients), so CSS really cleared up the whole website-building business. There are still many aspects of CSS I haven't delved into yet I'm sure, but today I'll be blogging about 2 topics I had issues with when first using it: when to use a class vs. an ID, and what the difference is between displaying an object inline vs. inline block.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One of the first technical bumps I ran into when creating my website was styling only certain portions of the HTML document.  To stick with the recipe metaphor, I wanted to know how to blend the sugar with the butter, in isolation of how the rest of the recipe comes together.  I knew there was a way to tag certain blocks of code as either a class or an ID, but to me they pretty much meant the same thing. After doing some research (and to be honest, playing around with my website), it looks like best practice is to use a class when multiple elements of your site need to be styled the same way, and to use an ID only on a specific one-time-use case.  I also found a great section in the CSS recommendations regarding specificity: an ID is vastly more specific than a class and as such will overrule other rules.  This is important when creating your CSS as it helps you figure out which portion of the CSS the HTML will follow.
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="CSS Rec Screenshot.png"/>

  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Another aspect that I had to do some extra reading on was the display rule.  In CSS, you can tell certain objects how to display on the page.  Three of those selections are inline, block, and inline block.  Displaying an object as a block renders the object literally as a block. Each object turns into a square shaped area, and each block stacks under the previous one.  Displaying an object inline means pretty much what it says.  You can think of inline objects like text.  Each object goes to the right of the previous one, and they continue to loop around onto the next "line" of your page.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One of my initial questions was "What is the different between displaying objects inline vs. inline block?".  I think a visual is the best way to understand this concept, but it looks to me like inline block is essentially the best of both an inline object and a block object. Both inline and block displays are relatively rigid: inline elements cannot have a width or a height set, and block elements force a line break after it (stacking).  Inline block combines the two and allows elements to sit next to each other horizontally while also respecting a defined height and width.  Here is a visual representation:

<h3>Chef's Kitchen</h3>
  <h4>February 25, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This blog post will take a slightly different angle, and will cover my impressions and expectations of DBC, and go through some of my thoughts surrounding Shereef's fireside chat.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To begin with, let's discuss DBC's culture and experience.  My impression of DBC's culture is that of fostering creativity and expression, while learning valuable skills.  One of the main reasons I chose DBC over other bootcamp-style courses was because of their learning structure.  Not to go off on a tangent about the state of this country's education system, but it needs to be reformed. I obviously don't have the qualifications to dictate how it should be done, but I think that some of the ideas and styles practiced by DBC have the right idea.  I firmly believe that education should be about learning and challenging yourself versus studying to a test or memorizing answers to receive better grades.  Unfortunately I think many people, especially those from my decade, were taught this way.  We were brought up in a culture where you have to memorize only what is being taught on a test, in order to get better grades, in order to get into the best college, etc, etc.  I think how Shereef describes the "kitchen" mindset is a better way to approach learning and the educational environment.  I have high hopes that my cohort will come into this experience as a team and that we will dictate our own learning and growth.  I love the idea that we will all be in this together and we will all be eager to help each other out, teach each other new things, and inspire each other to pursue our passions.

    Second of all, I am very excited to be surrounded by people with the same passions and aspirations.  It is very tough to be in an environment where people are not interested in technology to go off and learn this material on my own.  I have also found that it isn't practical as I don't have an outlet to practice or keep up with my skills.  The same can be said for the learning and growth mindset.  I think that in the corporate world today (specifically my current company), many people have closed minds when it comes to reforming a process.  I think that most environments can be improved upon, but it requires people that are motivated to do the work.  I've found that many higher executives do not have an open mind in this regard and are not willing to think about making changes that may improve the company culture if it requires extra work to get there.

    I also want to speak to Shereef's point on the two fears that people have entering DBC.  As someone with very little programming experience before DBC, I definitely admit to having the first fear - that I am way behind everyone in the rest of my cohort.  I will give myself credit for being a fast learner though and I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can from the rest of my cohort.  I hope by the end of this process I can say that I've also been able to contribute to someone else's learning experience by teaching them something that may play to my strengths.

  <h3>Git Bloggin'</h3>

    As a completely new programmer myself, I am writing this blog in hopes of tracking my own thoughts as well as potentially educating others who are interested in learning about programming.  This post is my first technical blog and will cover the basics of git: version control, how git tracks changes, and the benefits of using GitHub to store code.

    First things first: what is git? Git is a tool that you can download to your computer which makes it easy to track changes to certain documents and merge changes.  It is very similar in concept to how the tracking changes functionality works in Microsoft Word.  Not only can you use it alone to track your own changes and update files, but it also allows multiple people to work on the same file and make changes which can then be merged to produce a final version. Git uses something called version control to do this - essentially it saves a separate version of a file every time you tell it to.  This can be useful if you make an error in a file and want to revert to how the file was at an earlier point in time.  The more times you save your changes, the more possibilities exist for this.  Developers use version control to be able to revert to prior code when something in the new code fails.  Oftentimes code is crucial to business operations and it is imperative to be able to revert to the tested, working code in order to get a project done.  Version control allows the developer to re-deploy the working code, and then go back and make the necessary updates to new code.

    GitHub is an online storage system for code.  Developers use GitHub to remotely store their code, so others can access it and make changes of their own.  The benefits of this is that you can have multiple people making changes to the same document housed on GitHub and the system will keep track of these and merge them at the end to form one coherent document.  The individuals don't have to be in the same location to collaborate on a project.

<h3>Thinking Style</h3>
  <h4>March 14, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog focuses on our thinking styles.  After taking the short quiz (<a class="inline_link" href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">found here</a>), I was not surprised to find that I am a concrete sequential thinker.  Some of the things concrete sequential thinkers like are order, getting something right at the first attempt, and following precise, specific directions.  I can honestly say that my personality is in-line with this description 100%.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    In some ways, my thinking style has jived very well with Phase 0 of DBC.  We have very straightforward instructions, and a logical order to complete tasks in.  However, in other ways I have had to expand my work style.  For example, one thing that is difficult for concrete sequential thinkers to do is work in groups.  DBC is all about peer learning, and group work, which has been an adjustment for me.  I know that I prefer to work through problems and learn on my own and I have had to adjust my preferences in order to follow the curriculum.  I also know that I like to stay on task, which can be difficult if I'm pairing with someone who goes out of order, or can go off on a tangent.  While those discussions can sometimes be beneficial, part of me always wants to just continue with the task at hand.  I think that part of this process will be about me being flexible and open to other's insights and processes, and trying things in a different way.

  <article>
    With that being said, I'm going into this process, and time in my life, with an open mind.  I know that I wasn't happy with the way things were before, and I think changing my mind-set can help with that.  I've always had a very fixed mindset (developed mainly I think from the culture I grew up in) - being afraid of failure, not taking risks, and believing that you're either the best or you're nothing.  Unfortunately I think many people my age, and from my hometown, would agree with this.  We were raised this way.  But it doesn't make it the right mindset, and I think we can all work on changing this to be better people.  By leaving my stable, well-paying job behind, and no set future, I am taking the biggest risk I ever have, in pursuit of finding meaning in my life and in my career.  I have realized that I'm not content sitting behind a desk doing nothing with my time in order to earn a hefty salary to afford nice things.  I'd rather be happy every day with less money, more knowledge, and a sense of fulfillment.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    So far in Phase 0 I am trying to catch myself whenever I fall back into a fixed mindset, and changing the way I'm viewing something.  For example, I was very nervous before the first guided pairing session.  In my mind, I didn't want to say or do something wrong because I didn't want to look stupid in front of others.  I also knew that we would be getting feedback from these sessions, and I wanted the best possible "grade".  Afterwards, I realized that I needed to take a step back from this, and understand that this is the time to take a risk and really internalize whatever feedback is given to me to improve upon myself.  I know I won't be graduating this program with a GPA tied to my name, or a class ranking, so I need to take this oppotunity to learn as much as I can, and grow as much as I can.

  <h3>Ruby Arrays and Hashes</h3>
  <h4>March 14, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    When I first started learning Ruby on Codecademy, before Phase 0, I thought Arrays and Hashes were two completely separate things.  Even as I read blog posts from DBC alumni about how they kept picking the wrong thing, I thought to myself, they're totally different, how could you get them confused?  Well, it makes a lot more sense now.  As it turns out, Arrays and Hashes in Ruby are very similar.  Both are ways of storing and indexing information. Both have keys and values.  And both grow as more information is added.  But there is one key difference: information in Arrays are organized using an integer as the key, whereas anything can be a key with Hashes (a string, float number, etc.)
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To take a step back, when you think of an index, such as one in a textbook, each key word or phrase is assigned to a page number where information can be found about it.  This is exactly how information is stored in both arrays and hashes.  An array is simply a collection of information organized in a logical sequence.  It looks something like this:
    <pre>
      array = [1,2,3,4,5]
    </pre>
    Each number within the brackets is indexed according to the position it's in.  So "1" is in the zero-eth position; its key is 0 and the value is 1.  "2" is in the first position; its key is 1 and the value is 2, and so on and so forth.  Once the array is created you can tell the computer to print the value by inputting the key.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    You can have an array full of other types of things, such as this:
  <pre>
    array_2 = ["Sam",2,"DBC",8.06]
  </pre>
    The basic construct of the key and value pairs still exists. If you ask the computer what value is stored in the key 3, the response will be 8.06.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Hashes on the other hand can have non-numeric keys.  As such you define both the key and the value.  For example:
  <pre>
    months{
      "January" => 1,
      "February" => 2,
      "March" => 3,
    }
  </pre>
    As you can see above, January is now a key and 1 is its value.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    In short, while arrays and hashes are very similar methods of storing information, there are definitely use cases for both, and it's important to consider the project you're working on, and the scope of the data, before deciding which method to use.

  <h3>CSS Technical Blog</h3>
  <h4>March 3, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Since week 2 had a reputation for being the most time-consuming, in true Sam-fashion I started on the challenges Friday night and worked through the weekend.  I have a fear about not being able to succeed at this, compunded by working at my job full-time still, so it's important to me to be as ahead of the ball as I can be.  I had started the HTML Codecademy course before Phase 0, but I had never heard of or touched CSS.  For someone who doesn't know either, you can think of HTML and CSS like a recipe.  The list of ingredients is the HTML code, whereas the instructions are like the CSS.  The CSS tells the browser what to do with your HTML, and how certain elements should blend together.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To be honest, after going through the tutorial, I felt much better about the whole language.  HTML didn't make too much sense on its own (just like a recipe is rendered useless if you only have the list of ingredients), so CSS really cleared up the whole website-building business. There are still many aspects of CSS I haven't delved into yet I'm sure, but today I'll be blogging about 2 topics I had issues with when first using it: when to use a class vs. an ID, and what the difference is between displaying an object inline vs. inline block.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One of the first technical bumps I ran into when creating my website was styling only certain portions of the HTML document.  To stick with the recipe metaphor, I wanted to know how to blend the sugar with the butter, in isolation of how the rest of the recipe comes together.  I knew there was a way to tag certain blocks of code as either a class or an ID, but to me they pretty much meant the same thing. After doing some research (and to be honest, playing around with my website), it looks like best practice is to use a class when multiple elements of your site need to be styled the same way, and to use an ID only on a specific one-time-use case.  I also found a great section in the CSS recommendations regarding specificity: an ID is vastly more specific than a class and as such will overrule other rules.  This is important when creating your CSS as it helps you figure out which portion of the CSS the HTML will follow.

    Another aspect that I had to do some extra reading on was the display rule.  In CSS, you can tell certain objects how to display on the page.  Three of those selections are inline, block, and inline block.  Displaying an object as a block renders the object literally as a block. Each object turns into a square shaped area, and each block stacks under the previous one.  Displaying an object inline means pretty much what it says.  You can think of inline objects like text.  Each object goes to the right of the previous one, and they continue to loop around onto the next "line" of your page.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One of my initial questions was "What is the different between displaying objects inline vs. inline block?".  I think a visual is the best way to understand this concept, but it looks to me like inline block is essentially the best of both an inline object and a block object. Both inline and block displays are relatively rigid: inline elements cannot have a width or a height set, and block elements force a line break after it (stacking).  Inline block combines the two and allows elements to sit next to each other horizontally while also respecting a defined height and width.  Here is a visual representation:

<h3>Chef's Kitchen</h3>
  <h4>February 25, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This blog post will take a slightly different angle, and will cover my impressions and expectations of DBC, and go through some of my thoughts surrounding Shereef's fireside chat.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To begin with, let's discuss DBC's culture and experience.  My impression of DBC's culture is that of fostering creativity and expression, while learning valuable skills.  One of the main reasons I chose DBC over other bootcamp-style courses was because of their learning structure.  Not to go off on a tangent about the state of this country's education system, but it needs to be reformed. I obviously don't have the qualifications to dictate how it should be done, but I think that some of the ideas and styles practiced by DBC have the right idea.  I firmly believe that education should be about learning and challenging yourself versus studying to a test or memorizing answers to receive better grades.  Unfortunately I think many people, especially those from my decade, were taught this way.  We were brought up in a culture where you have to memorize only what is being taught on a test, in order to get better grades, in order to get into the best college, etc, etc.  I think how Shereef describes the "kitchen" mindset is a better way to approach learning and the educational environment.  I have high hopes that my cohort will come into this experience as a team and that we will dictate our own learning and growth.  I love the idea that we will all be in this together and we will all be eager to help each other out, teach each other new things, and inspire each other to pursue our passions.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Second of all, I am very excited to be surrounded by people with the same passions and aspirations.  It is very tough to be in an environment where people are not interested in technology to go off and learn this material on my own.  I have also found that it isn't practical as I don't have an outlet to practice or keep up with my skills.  The same can be said for the learning and growth mindset.  I think that in the corporate world today (specifically my current company), many people have closed minds when it comes to reforming a process.  I think that most environments can be improved upon, but it requires people that are motivated to do the work.  I've found that many higher executives do not have an open mind in this regard and are not willing to think about making changes that may improve the company culture if it requires extra work to get there.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I also want to speak to Shereef's point on the two fears that people have entering DBC.  As someone with very little programming experience before DBC, I definitely admit to having the first fear - that I am way behind everyone in the rest of my cohort.  I will give myself credit for being a fast learner though and I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can from the rest of my cohort.  I hope by the end of this process I can say that I've also been able to contribute to someone else's learning experience by teaching them something that may play to my strengths.

  <h3>Git Bloggin'</h3>
  <h4>February 25, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    As a completely new programmer myself, I am writing this blog in hopes of tracking my own thoughts as well as potentially educating others who are interested in learning about programming.  This post is my first technical blog and will cover the basics of git: version control, how git tracks changes, and the benefits of using GitHub to store code.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    First things first: what is git? Git is a tool that you can download to your computer which makes it easy to track changes to certain documents and merge changes.  It is very similar in concept to how the tracking changes functionality works in Microsoft Word.  Not only can you use it alone to track your own changes and update files, but it also allows multiple people to work on the same file and make changes which can then be merged to produce a final version. Git uses something called version control to do this - essentially it saves a separate version of a file every time you tell it to.  This can be useful if you make an error in a file and want to revert to how the file was at an earlier point in time.  The more times you save your changes, the more possibilities exist for this.  Developers use version control to be able to revert to prior code when something in the new code fails.  Oftentimes code is crucial to business operations and it is imperative to be able to revert to the tested, working code in order to get a project done.  Version control allows the developer to re-deploy the working code, and then go back and make the necessary updates to new code.

    GitHub is an online storage system for code.  Developers use GitHub to remotely store their code, so others can access it and make changes of their own.  The benefits of this is that you can have multiple people making changes to the same document housed on GitHub and the system will keep track of these and merge them at the end to form one coherent document.  The individuals don't have to be in the same location to collaborate on a project.

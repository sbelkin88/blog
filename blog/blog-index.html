  <h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
  <h4>April 21, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One of the main things I've learned during Phase 0 has been that google is your best friend when learning to code.  I've found that I always have questions that aren't addressed in the codecademy courses or in the documentation, and it's important to be able to find those answers on google.  Outside of posting a question on stack overflow or a similar website, it's important to be able to phrase a question on a search engine to be able to get the best website answers possible.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I think question-writing is very similar to writing/editing in general as it's best practice to make sure everything is spelled correctly, your grammar is accurate, and you're including all necessary information.  In a coding context, it's important to include what language you're working in, and possibly an example of your code (as long as you aren't posting a company's private code) so that someone can review it and see what's going on.  I think it can also be beneficial to specify what type of computer you're using, especially for help with using the terminal or installing software.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    The biggest hurdle I've had in finding an answer during Phase 0 was not knowing how to phrase a question correctly.  For example, on a recent challenge we had to create a nested for loop through an object in JavaScript, but all answers kept being about iterating through nested arrays. It was a bit frustrating trying to phrase my question specifically enough to find a good resource without typing out the exact situation.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I think being able to ask good questions in person is just as important, if not more so, than being able to successfully find resources online.  I've found through my work experience that people's time is the most valuable resource.  An important thing to keep in mind in real-life situations is to first sit down and think about the question that you want to ask.  Have you asked this before?  Do you have any existing notes or resources you can utilize first?  If not, it's important to be as concise and clear as possible.  Start with a high level background describing the circumstance and then ask the specific question you had in mind.  If you start with the question, another person might have no clue what you're talking about and then you have to back up and give the broader overview anyways.  After you ask the question, I think it's also a good habit to write a note for yourself on what the response was so that you have something to reference later on.  You always think you'll remember the answer later, but I've found that's generally not the case.  It's better to refer to your own notes later, rather than asking the same question twice.

  <h3>Building My Website</h3>
  <h4>April 22, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week I decided to purchase a domain name for my website and try to set it up - this wound up being much more complicated than I thought it would be (and I think it should be), but with some help from my dad, I got it working, and thought I'd write about the process.  This post will be solely about linking a GitHub pages site with a custom domain name.  You can see the <a href ="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/" class="inline_link">GitHub FAQ page</a> from which I started.  First you need to purchase a domain name (URL) through a DNS (domain name system) provider like GoDaddy - you can find deals for around $0.99 for the first year.  In this case, my site will still be hosted by GitHub, so I didn't pay for hosting services, just the URL.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Next you need to add a CNAME file to your GitHub repo - you can do this by creating a new file in Sublime (or any text editor) and saving it as CNAME in your root directory of your repo.  The only text in the file should be your URL that you purchased (in my case www.samanthasarah.com).  By using a CNAME file, you are using the subdomain, so you have to include the "www." at the beginning.  Once this has been committed, you should be able to click on your repo's settings and it should say something along the lines of "Your site is published at http://www.samanthasarah.com".  This is needed in order to link your personal GitHub page with your URL.  In the next step you are only linking your domain name to GitHub's IP address, and this file provides the link to your specific site.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Now comes the tricky part - you have to set this up on the DNS provider's side as well.  I purchased my URL through GoDaddy, so I went to their website to login and manage my domain there.  Under your control panel on their site you should be able to add/edit your DNS Zones.  Under the CNAME section, you add a record with the Host of www and it Points To your github.io page.  By doing this, when you type www.samanthasarah.com in the browser, your github.io site will load.  You could feasibly stop here, but you wouldn't be able to get to your site if a user typed anything but that exact URL (for example samanthasarah.com wouldn't work).  In order for all cases to work we have to set-up an "A" record which is also managed in the same area of your DNS provider.  The Host in this case should be @ and it should Point To the IP address of your host (in this case GitHub) - I had to search through their FAQ to find this, but it's located <a href ="https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/" class = "inline_link">here</a>.  Once you set-up both of these records, a user can get to your website by either including or excluding the "www." portion of your URL.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I hope that was helpful, and good luck setting up your own custom URLs for your personal site!

  <h3>Conflict</h3>
  <h4>April 12, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog focuses on conflict, and the basic emotions that arise during it.  The most recent conflict I had was the week before I left my job, and one of my managers asked me to go and set-up all of my deliverables that are sent via email, in our automated workflow tool to show as reminders.  I thought that this was a pointless exercise since the concept of reminders doesn't really exist in this system.  Once we set-up the event, it doesn't disappear until the deliverable is sent out through the tool, or a manager manually deletes the event.  In this case, since these deliverables are sent via email, a manager would have to go and manually delete each event as they are completed.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    In my opinion, this was a waste of time on my part, as it takes roughly 5 minutes to set-up each event, and I was setting up around 30-35 events, and it was a waste of time on the manager's side as they would have to go and delete all these events every quarter when they appeared.  On a deeper level I was upset because they didn't value my time (albeit I was leaving the job, and they knew that), but I was also upset that they wanted to create and maintain an even more "babysitter" culture.  In my old job, if a person forgot to do something repeatedly, or didn't do a good job, they wouldn't get reprimanded, or face the possibility of losing their job - they would only get more "babysat" and someone would have to add to their list to continually remind this person of tasks that needed to be completed.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I feel that this practice is very unfair to those of us that actually do a good job since we don't get rewarded for it; we could also do a terrible job and get babysat, and still receive the same salary and benefits.  I was upset that my management chose to enable this behavior and continue this practice instead of addressing the real issue and saving everybody the headache of the extra responsibilities.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Unfortunately, being at a disadvantage, I wasn't really able to say anything.  I re-asked the objective and tried to make them explain, but there wasn't really an option for me.  I pride myself on doing a good job for the team, and wanted to leave my job with good relationships intact, so I completed the task as asked.  I do think they got the hint that I thought it was a meaningless exercise however.  In this particular circumstance I don't think I could have/would have done anything differently, but I do wish that there had been a way to discuss the root issues with someone higher up on my team.  I think that if the culture of the team changed, we could all be capable of doing more and producing better work, instead of having the responsibilities of someone else's job on our shoulders as well as our own.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    From this experience (and really all the prior experiences of the same nature leading up to this) was that I needed a new firm culture to be a part of.  I don't want to be on a team that accepts laziness and rewards it, but rather a team where everyone gives it their all, and takes pride in their work.  This was obviously a decision I came to before this moment of conflict, but it brought out the same feelings and made me more sure of my move.

  <h3>Recursion</h3>
  <h4>April 16, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Recursion is a programming function in which you have self-referential definitions.  What this means is that the method or function calls itself.  You can think of recursion like a loop, but instead of writing an <code>each</code>, <code>for</code>, or <code>while</code> loop, the method just keeps calling itself until the defintion tells it to stop.  This is an important aspect of using recursion, because if you don't include what's called a base case, the method will run indefinitely (or until your program crashes).
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Here is a basic example of a method using recursion:
    <pre>
      def greeting(n)
        if n<=0
          p "Bye!"
        else
          p "Hi!"
          greeting(n-1)
        end
      end
    </pre>
    If you then call this method by writing:
    <pre>
      greeting(3)
    </pre>
    your output would be:
    <pre>
      "Hi!"
      "Hi!"
      "Hi!"
      "Bye!"
    </pre>
    What this does it you define your base case as n<=0, where the method will print "Bye" and the program ends.  Otherwise it calls the method again using n-1.  So in this example the first time the program runs, n=3 so it prints "Hi!" and runs the method again with n=2.  This also prints "Hi!" and runs the method again with n=1.  Yet again it prints "Hi!" and then runs the method with n=0.  In this case we hit our base case so the method just prints "Bye!" and ends.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Methods with recursion can be very powerful, such as creating a method to create factorials or add all the numbers in a range.  Instead of having to iterate, you can use recursion and it will keep adding to a running total. For large tasks, recursion can generally be written with less code than iteration, and can be cleaner.  However with smaller tasks, iteration can be better to use as you don't have to worry about the call running indefinitely.

  <h3>Values and Self-Affirmation</h3>
  <h4>April 9, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    **Disclaimer: this blog is based solely my opinion, and is not meant to discourage others' opinions**
  <p></p>
    The purpose of this week's cultural blog is to identify a few core values that are important to us and talk about how we can use self-affirmation with these values to help us succeed. To give a brief background on the topic, the practice of self-affirmation means that you identify values that are important to you and reflect on them in the face of adversity.  Several studies have shown that self-affirmation leads to a more favorable outcome - for example, performing better in school, and becoming healthier.  On the flip side of things, there are just as many studies which have been conducted and have not shown any differences due to self-affirmation. I think the process of identifying your underlying values, and reminding yourself of them, is an extremely positive practice, however I'm not convinced that this will be a life-changing solution.  I don't think self-affirmation is a magical cure that will improve your grades and make your skinnier.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One thing that also stuck out to me in all the reading is that, throughout all the scientific studies that were done, self-affirmation is found to be non-effective in non-marginalized groups.  While being a woman puts me in a "marginalized group", I don't think self-affirmation will have an effect if you don't feel marginalized to start with.  As mentioned last week, I personally do not feel the stereotype threat that women are not as intelligent as men in math; therefore I doubt self-affirmation would do anything to improve my grades in math.  Not to say that this is a waste of an exercise, but my thinking leads me to the other end of the spectrum.  Instead of focusing on self-affirmation, should we not be focusing on ending the marginalization and stereotypes in the first place?
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I think that self-affirmation can be a great tool, especially as an interim solution.  However, I think a longer-term solution of more (and better) education and projects to eliminate the root cause would be more beneficial.  By promoting acceptance and having empathy for those around us, I think we can really change our society as a whole, which could considerably lessen the number of people who feel marginalized.  I'm not claiming to have all the answers, but in my opinion, repeating stereotypes only functions to sustain them.  By telling children there is a stereotype that boys will get better grades in math, I think you're perpetuating this and drawing attention to it, instead of encouraging them to be the best they can be, regardless of their gender.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To get back to the topic at hand, some of the values that I find most important are: having a family, health, honesty, compassion, and persistence.  When you get down to it, our society has become more and more focused on material items and impressing others, when I think we should really be looking inwards and seeing if we are living the life we want and if we are being kind, empathetic individuals.  I don't think it means much if we're going about life just to earn money to afford fancy cars or houses if we hate our jobs and are unhappy day after day.  I'd rather be happy than be swimming in money.  In addition to being kinder to ourselves, I think our society needs to be turned around too and people need to start being kinder to each other, more accepting of other beliefs, cultures, and customs, and more empathetic of others' situations.

  <h3>JavaScript vs. Ruby</h3>
  <h4>April 8, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week we got our first glimpse into JavaScript.  Objectively speaking, the language is pretty similar to Ruby, and most of the concepts that exist in Ruby also exist in JavaScript, albeit with different syntax.  However, as we dug deeper it became more and more clear that JavaScript just doesn't have as many built-in capabilities as Ruby does.  I found myself wanting to do something that was so easy in Ruby (like calling a built-in method), and instead having to write the function in JavaScript first and then call it.  I remember back to my first week with Ruby and I felt lost because there was so much you could do, it felt infinite. I remember longing for the structure of SQL that I knew, but now that I'm playing in JavaScript, part of me keeps longing to go back and use Ruby instead! I do think that learning Ruby first was extremely helpful though, as catching onto JavaScript has been significantly easier since the underlying principles are very similar.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    While similar, the syntax and structure of JavaScript does have some major differences.  For example, iterating (looping) through data structures not the same.  Whereas Ruby has many built-in methods that can tell how long your data structure is, and go through each instance automatically, JavaScript does not, and you have to tell the code how long you want the loop to go for.  Also whereas Ruby has several different ways of going about this (see previous post on <a class="inline_link" href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">Enumerables</a>), JavaScript really has 2 - <code>while</code> statements, and <code>for</code> statements.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Let's go through both examples.  First we'll define an array that we want to iterate through, for example:
    <pre>
      var array = ["1","2","3","4","5"]
    </pre>
    A <code>while</code> statement for this array would look like this:
    <pre>
      var counter = 0;
      while (counter < array.length){
        console.log(array[counter]);
        counter ++;
      }
    </pre>
    Going through the code, we first define a variable called counter and set it equal to 0.  The text in the parentheses tell the loop how many time to execute.  In this case we want the loop to execute the length of the array - 1.  So here the length of the array is 5, and the loop will actually run 5 times since we are starting the variable at 0.  So it will run when counter is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order to go through each element of the array (remember the index of the array begins at 0, not 1). The code in the curly brackets then is the code that should be executed.  So we are telling the computer, for every loop, print out the element of the array to the console, and add 1 to the counter.  If we don't include the last part, the code will just print out the first element of the array to infinity (or until it crashes).
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    <code>For</code> statements are very similar, but it allows you to write everything on one line instead of breaking it out.  So the same example as above but in a <code>for</code> loop would look like this:
    <pre>
      for (var counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter ++){
        console.log(array[counter]);
      }
    </pre>
    Again, to go through the code, the text in the parentheses are just setting the stage for how you want the loop to run, and the text in the curly bracket is the code to be executed each loop.  The elements in the parantheses are separated by semi-colons: the first element sets our counter variable to 0, the second element tells the loop to run the length of the array - 1 times, and the last element adds 1 to the counter variable on each run.  The code to be executed is just printing out to the console each element of the array.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To illustrate the difference between this and how Ruby executes loops, let's look at the same example in Ruby.  We have our array:
    <pre>
      array = ["1","2","3","4","5"]
    </pre>
    Now, instead of having to write all that code like in JavaScript, we can use an easy built-in method like this:
    <pre>
      array.each {|element| puts element}
    </pre>
    With Ruby you don't have to explicitly tell the loop how long to execute for, it will automatically go through every element in the array given.  So as mentioned above, while similar, the languages have different capabilities and built-in methods, as well as slightly different syntax.
  </article>

  <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
  <h4>April 1, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog is focused on an anomaly called stereotype threat. Stereotype threat occurs when a subset of a group of people who are all evenly qualified underperform based on expectations.  For example, women might perform worse on math tests due to the stigma that men are better at math, even though they have just as much knowledge and are as well prepared.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Personally I can't say that I've been affected by this, even though I am a woman who pursued a degree in a predominately male field.  I think this is mainly due to the circumstances in which I was raised, and the environment of the schools I attended.  I don't feel like anyone around me has ever mentioned that stereotype or encouraged it.  My only experience (and seeing my peers' experiences) with underperformance has been from not being prepared enough or test anxiety in general.  While I've certainly been nervous about failing, it's been more about my own insecurities rather than because I'm female.  In several articles I read, this wasn't the case with stereotype threat.  Instead, minority groups performed equally well on tests such as the SAT, but underperformed when told the test would judge them on their intelligence level.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I think this issue can be mediated through changing the environments that students are exposed to.  Stereotypes exist due to people continuing to spread them and lumping people into categories. If school instead was focused on learning and each individual's potential and merit, we can remove the focus on students' gender/race/etc.

  <h3>Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas</h3>
  <h4>March 31, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas - does it sound like we're back in a Frat house in college yet?  As opposed to Greek letters, Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas are actually important tools that you can use in Ruby code.  They are essentially snippets of code which you tell the computer to do within a method.  We've already seen them when using enumerables, but here is an example:
    <pre>
    def method(arguments)
      arguments.each {|argument| do something to the argument}
    end
    </pre>
    The little bit in the curly brackets {} is what we call a Bloc.  Blocs function like a method in that they are telling the code to do something, but they are technically undefined and unnamed.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Procs are very similar to Blocs in that they also are bits of code which tell the computer to do something, however they are different in that they are defined and saved as a variable.  So you can take the exact same code as in our example above and define it as a variable which then can get passed into the method, instead of writing it out:
    <pre>
    proc = Proc.new {|argument| do something to the argument}

    def method(arguments)
      arguments.each(&proc)
    end
    </pre>
    The only difference here is that you use the "&" sign when you pull the Proc into your method.  These can be useful when you want to assign your Proc more than one thing to do, or if you want to refer back to it multiple times in your code.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Last, but not least, we have Lambdas.  Lambdas are rarely used, but they are the same thing as Procs, but are more detailed like methods.  The other main difference is that you can use the "return" keyword within a Lambda since it will only return the Lambda, not the entire method.  If you use "return" in a Bloc or a Proc, it will exit out of the entire method at the return.  The other main difference is that Lambdas will check the number of arguments passed into it (like methods), whereas Procs and Blocs do not.

  <h3>Feedback in DBC</h3>
  <h4>March 29, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    For our cultural blog this week we're asked to discuss our experience around pairing and feedback.  For someone not familiar with the term, pairing is the exercise of video chatting with another programmer as you work through a problem, and you both contribute to the code in a shared app.  For me, pairing has been both enjoyable and overwhelming so far.  I think that pairing is a great idea in Phase 0 as we are all working remotely so we can meet one another and ask questions if we get stuck.  I can also see other real-world benefits of it, for example if one person gets stuck, the pair can assist, or stopping one other from making the solution too complicated/going down rabbit holes.  On the other hand, I am very much an introvert.  I learn best by working through things in my head, and most of the time I prefer to solidify the concepts on my own.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    It's been tough for me to try and think out loud because I find it hard to keep track of things out loud.  For instance, when reading through the instructions out loud - I'm paying attention to reading them, instead of understanding what I'm supposed to do.  I find that I have to re-read the instructions in my head afterwards so I know where to go next.  I have also had the feeling of being overwhelmed to come up with an idea right away.  When you're sharing the code screen, sometimes I just want to sit and think about the problem for a minute, but my pair might want to actually play around with the code which makes things difficult sometimes.  I find myself wanting to copy the code all the time to a separate window so I can just think about the problem as it is on the screen. Overall I'm enthusiastic about the idea, but not sure if I'd want to be pairing in my job all day, every day.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To switch gears and move onto the feedback portion, I think my experience has been a bit different.  I've been working at a job which requires daily communication both internally at my firm as well as externally with clients, so I think I have a good grip on being able to communicate while pairing and creating a positive environment to work in.  On that note, my feedback that I've received so far has been more about thinking out loud more rather than on how I interact with others. I do really value getting feedback in general though during this remote portion of the program as it gives us a good benchmark as to how far along we are comparatively and makes sure we're on par with the expectations of the course.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I felt that writing feedback as specified for this program is a bit difficult as it should be specific without including details such as gender, and knowing it will be broadcasted and rated.  I'm definitely still working on providing helpful feedback in a kind manner to ensure that the message is coming across without inadvertently upsetting the other person.  I've also had some wonderful pairing sessions in which I struggled to come up with any actionable items.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Overall I think both pairing and feedback are great learning tools in this program especially now when we are all remote.  The A.S.K. (Actionable, Specific, and Kind) concept of feedback is one of the things I love about DBC's culture as it promotes learning and growth, and I'm glad to be learning and adopting this mindset.

  <h3>Ruby Classes</h3>
  <h4>March 29, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    When working with Ruby, methods are the basic code which tells the computer to do something.   This capability is great, but what happens when you are routinely running multiple methods, and can't easily find the code you need?  Classes are a functionality in Ruby which allows you to group all the methods that are applicable to certain types of objects.  You can then run an instance of the Class, and all the methods are there for you.  It saves time and confusion by bucketing them all together.  Let's run through an example: in finance, an asset manager needs to keep track of, and be able to quickly access, multiple data points relating to any one of their portfolios.  Let's build a class which will allow us to do that.  We first need to initialize the class by parsing in the portfolio's name and perhaps a short code for ease of reference, along with a date that you would want the output to be as-of:
    <pre>
    class PortfolioInfo

      def initialize (name, short_code, date)
      @name = name
      @short_code = short_code
      @date = date
      end

      #other code here to query underlying databases

    end
    </pre>
    Now we can write however many methods where the comments are which will take either the full portfolio name, or the short code, and use it to query underlying databases to gather information on the account as of the specified date - for example key metrics (P/E, Average Market Cap, Turnover), or generate a list of holdings as of that date. This saves us from having to write new methods every time we want to access a piece of data.  We can also run this for as many portfolios and dates as we want to.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    The information that we initially parse into the instance becomes what are called instance variables - they are defined at the top with the "@" sign in front of them, and this allows them to be used and referenced throughout the other methods you build within the class.

  <h3>Tech Issues</h3>
  <h4>March 16, 2015</h4>

    When I saw the topic for this week's cultural blog - "Issues in Tech" - I knew exactly what I wanted to research.  It's no secret that being a woman in tech is rare.  But why is this the case?  When I started out on this path to DBC, I received more than a few "why are you doing this?" and "what made you interested in programming?" questions.  It's difficult to answer these and be enthusiastic about this path when they're looking at you like you have three heads and have gone insane.  But is it really that "crazy" for a woman to want to switch industries and learn how to code?  Especially, as it turns out, a caucasian woman?  I'd like that answer to be no.  While I received great enthusiasm from friends who were already in the tech industry, the reactions were not the same from others.

    From doing some initial research, it seems there are several main issues surrounding women in tech: lack of early learning/exposure for young girls and teens, lack of women role models/mentors in the industry, and continuing sexism and harrassment during interviews and in the workplace.
  </article>

  <article>
    Just as technology is a continually changing industry, I think that gender roles need to play catch-up and change along with it.  Throughout history women have had to continually fight for more and more rights, and I think unfortunately, the time has come for this fight to happen in technology.  This needs to start with the younger generation - if you don't start teaching younger girls about the tech world, no one will grow up to take our places. I can personally relate to this as I knew nothing about this industry until about two years ago (when I was 24!).  Programming/web-developing/entrepreneurship is something that should be introduced to kids back in middle school, and should be continued through college.  I feel that this is something that all kids could benefit from and would go a long way to introduce girls to the industry and teach them valuable skills early in life.  If this trend continues, we could exponentially increase the number of women pursuing degrees in tech fields and continuing into the industry after college.  If there were more of an equal gender balance in the industry, decisions like mine wouldn't be seen as being so strange.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This issue is a natural introduction to the next: the fact that there are so few mentors or women role models in the industry.  If you create a cycle of introducing young girls to technology, they will grow up to be mentors for the next generation.  The cycle has to start somewhere - why not have it start with us?  I feel a huge responsibility as a woman going into tech to give back, and do my part to be a mentor to other women.  I think we can be pivotal in implementing programs in the schools we grew up in and starting the trend.  When kids have a real-life role model to look up to, today's far-fetched idea becomes tomorrow's potential reality.  They will be able to see someone else accomplish it, and will have a path to follow in.

  <article>
    Last, but certainly not least, the culture of the tech industry needs a major facelift.  Companies need to realize that by encouraging and allowing sexism and harrassment to occur in their workplaces, they are hurting the entire community.  A crucial aspect of technology is that it's ever-growing and ever-changing, and we need to keep inventing and creating in order to keep that up.  Firms need to realize that the next biggest and best idea may (and very probably will) come from a woman, and they should want that woman on their team to develop it.  I think a big part of evolving in this space comes from the hiring process today.  Yes, I understand culture, and "fit", is a big part of whether you hire someone or not, but merit should play an equally large part.  Resumes should be evaluated on skill instead of the name at the top of the page, or the picture you find when you google said name.  Then bring the person in and see if they happen to be a cultural fit as well.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I think men in this industry have an equally large responsibility on their shoulders.  Create change in your own circles and companies.  Encourage your firm to hire great thinkers regardless of gender, and treat them with the same respect you show your male colleagues.  I believe the harrassment and condescending behavior needs to end, and we need a higher set of standards for ourselves.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I hope that my generation can succeed where past generations haven't, and that we can overcome the issues that women face in this industry.  I hope that we can put in the effort to invest in future generations and spark the trend that changes tech's culture. I know I will be doing my part. Will you do yours?

  <h3>Ruby Enumerables</h3>
  <h4>March 16, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Enumerables.  What the heck does that word even mean?  When first reading up on Enumerables, we were supposed to research certain Enumerable methods like <code>map</code>, <code>group_by</code>, and <code>cycle</code>.  However, when looking up <code>map</code> in the Ruby docs, I was directed towards the section on Arrays, which confused me even more.  Is map a method used on Arrays, or a method under Enumerables?  As it turns out, it's really both.  An Enumerable is simply a collection of methods which can be used to search or manipulate collections of data (therefore they can be used to search or manipulate Arrays as an example).  Therefore to break it down even further, <code>map</code> is a method belonging to a class of methods called Enumerables, which can be used on collections of data such as Arrays and Hashes.  Make sense?
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    There are a few different types of Enumerable methods which do different things:
    <ul>
      <li>Methods which don't actually touch the underlying data and just go through each item</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>each</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods that pull certain elements out of the underlying data based on criteria and populate a new collection with them</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>select</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods which change all underlying elements through a block and populate a new collection with them.  Note this does not alter the original collection.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>collect</code></li>
          <li><code>map</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods which actually change the original collection of data (are destructive). </li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>map!</code></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Methods which take a collection of underlying data and reduces it to a single value (i.e. adding up all elements). </li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>inject</code></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Getting a little off topic, the original purpose of this post was to discuss one Enumerable, of which I chose <code>map</code>. Map essentially creates a new collection of data (let's call it an Array going forward for ease), using all the original elements of an array, and changes them using a block.  The syntax looks like this:
    <pre>
      array.map {|element| element+2}
    </pre>
    What this says is take each element of the original array, add 2 to it, and populate the new value in a new array.  So if the original array was <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>, the new array would look like <code>[3,4,5,6,7]</code>. This is helpful as you can use this method either destructively (using <code>map!</code>), or non-destructively using <code>map</code>.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    <code>map</code> can also be used with Hashes, but you must include both the key and value in the code.  For example:
    <pre>
      hash.map {|key, value| value+2}
    </pre>

  <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
  <h4>March 14, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog focuses on our thinking styles.  After taking the short quiz (<a class="inline_link" href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">found here</a>), I was not surprised to find that I am a concrete sequential thinker.  Some of the things concrete sequential thinkers like are order, getting something right at the first attempt, and following precise, specific directions.  I can honestly say that my personality is in-line with this description 100%.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    In some ways, my thinking style has jived very well with Phase 0 of DBC.  We have very straightforward instructions, and a logical order to complete tasks in.  However, in other ways I have had to expand my work style.  For example, one thing that is difficult for concrete sequential thinkers to do is work in groups.  DBC is all about peer learning, and group work, which has been an adjustment for me.  I know that I prefer to work through problems and learn on my own and I have had to adjust my preferences in order to follow the curriculum.  I also know that I like to stay on task, which can be difficult if I'm pairing with someone who goes out of order, or can go off on a tangent.  While those discussions can sometimes be beneficial, part of me always wants to just continue with the task at hand.  I think that part of this process will be about me being flexible and open to other's insights and processes, and trying things in a different way.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    With that being said, I'm going into this process, and time in my life, with an open mind.  I know that I wasn't happy with the way things were before, and I think changing my mind-set can help with that.  I've always had a very fixed mindset (developed mainly I think from the culture I grew up in) - being afraid of failure, not taking risks, and believing that you're either the best or you're nothing.  Unfortunately I think many people my age, and from my hometown, would agree with this.  We were raised this way.  But it doesn't make it the right mindset, and I think we can all work on changing this to be better people.  By leaving my stable, well-paying job behind, and no set future, I am taking the biggest risk I ever have, in pursuit of finding meaning in my life and in my career.  I have realized that I'm not content sitting behind a desk doing nothing with my time in order to earn a hefty salary to afford nice things.  I'd rather be happy every day with less money, more knowledge, and a sense of fulfillment.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    So far in Phase 0 I am trying to catch myself whenever I fall back into a fixed mindset, and changing the way I'm viewing something.  For example, I was very nervous before the first guided pairing session.  In my mind, I didn't want to say or do something wrong because I didn't want to look stupid in front of others.  I also knew that we would be getting feedback from these sessions, and I wanted the best possible "grade".  Afterwards, I realized that I needed to take a step back from this, and understand that this is the time to take a risk and really internalize whatever feedback is given to me to improve upon myself.  I know I won't be graduating this program with a GPA tied to my name, or a class ranking, so I need to take this oppotunity to learn as much as I can, and grow as much as I can.

  <h3>Ruby Arrays and Hashes</h3>
  <h4>March 14, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    When I first started learning Ruby on Codecademy, before Phase 0, I thought Arrays and Hashes were two completely separate things.  Even as I read blog posts from DBC alumni about how they kept picking the wrong thing, I thought to myself, they're totally different, how could you get them confused?  Well, it makes a lot more sense now.  As it turns out, Arrays and Hashes in Ruby are very similar.  Both are ways of storing and indexing information. Both have keys and values.  And both grow as more information is added.  But there is one key difference: information in Arrays are organized using an integer as the key, whereas anything can be a key with Hashes (a string, float number, etc.)
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To take a step back, when you think of an index, such as one in a textbook, each key word or phrase is assigned to a page number where information can be found about it.  This is exactly how information is stored in both arrays and hashes.  An array is simply a collection of information organized in a logical sequence.  It looks something like this:
    <pre>
      array = [1,2,3,4,5]
    </pre>
    Each number within the brackets is indexed according to the position it's in.  So "1" is in the zero-eth position; its key is 0 and the value is 1.  "2" is in the first position; its key is 1 and the value is 2, and so on and so forth.  Once the array is created you can tell the computer to print the value by inputting the key.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    You can have an array full of other types of things, such as this:
  <pre>
    array_2 = ["Sam",2,"DBC",8.06]
  </pre>
    The basic construct of the key and value pairs still exists. If you ask the computer what value is stored in the key 3, the response will be 8.06.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Hashes on the other hand can have non-numeric keys.  As such you define both the key and the value.  For example:
  <pre>
    months{
      "January" => 1,
      "February" => 2,
      "March" => 3,
    }
  </pre>
    As you can see above, January is now a key and 1 is its value.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    In short, while arrays and hashes are very similar methods of storing information, there are definitely use cases for both, and it's important to consider the project you're working on, and the scope of the data, before deciding which method to use.

  <h3>CSS Technical Blog</h3>
  <h4>March 3, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Since week 2 had a reputation for being the most time-consuming, in true Sam-fashion I started on the challenges Friday night and worked through the weekend.  I have a fear about not being able to succeed at this, compunded by working at my job full-time still, so it's important to me to be as ahead of the ball as I can be.  I had started the HTML Codecademy course before Phase 0, but I had never heard of or touched CSS.  For someone who doesn't know either, you can think of HTML and CSS like a recipe.  The list of ingredients is the HTML code, whereas the instructions are like the CSS.  The CSS tells the browser what to do with your HTML, and how certain elements should blend together.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To be honest, after going through the tutorial, I felt much better about the whole language.  HTML didn't make too much sense on its own (just like a recipe is rendered useless if you only have the list of ingredients), so CSS really cleared up the whole website-building business. There are still many aspects of CSS I haven't delved into yet I'm sure, but today I'll be blogging about 2 topics I had issues with when first using it: when to use a class vs. an ID, and what the difference is between displaying an object inline vs. inline block.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One of the first technical bumps I ran into when creating my website was styling only certain portions of the HTML document.  To stick with the recipe metaphor, I wanted to know how to blend the sugar with the butter, in isolation of how the rest of the recipe comes together.  I knew there was a way to tag certain blocks of code as either a class or an ID, but to me they pretty much meant the same thing. After doing some research (and to be honest, playing around with my website), it looks like best practice is to use a class when multiple elements of your site need to be styled the same way, and to use an ID only on a specific one-time-use case.  I also found a great section in the CSS recommendations regarding specificity: an ID is vastly more specific than a class and as such will overrule other rules.  This is important when creating your CSS as it helps you figure out which portion of the CSS the HTML will follow.

  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Another aspect that I had to do some extra reading on was the display rule.  In CSS, you can tell certain objects how to display on the page.  Three of those selections are inline, block, and inline block.  Displaying an object as a block renders the object literally as a block. Each object turns into a square shaped area, and each block stacks under the previous one.  Displaying an object inline means pretty much what it says.  You can think of inline objects like text.  Each object goes to the right of the previous one, and they continue to loop around onto the next "line" of your page.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    One of my initial questions was "What is the different between displaying objects inline vs. inline block?".  I think a visual is the best way to understand this concept, but it looks to me like inline block is essentially the best of both an inline object and a block object. Both inline and block displays are relatively rigid: inline elements cannot have a width or a height set, and block elements force a line break after it (stacking).  Inline block combines the two and allows elements to sit next to each other horizontally while also respecting a defined height and width.  Here is a visual representation:

<h3>Chef's Kitchen</h3>
  <h4>February 25, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This blog post will take a slightly different angle, and will cover my impressions and expectations of DBC, and go through some of my thoughts surrounding Shereef's fireside chat.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    To begin with, let's discuss DBC's culture and experience.  My impression of DBC's culture is that of fostering creativity and expression, while learning valuable skills.  One of the main reasons I chose DBC over other bootcamp-style courses was because of their learning structure.  Not to go off on a tangent about the state of this country's education system, but it needs to be reformed. I obviously don't have the qualifications to dictate how it should be done, but I think that some of the ideas and styles practiced by DBC have the right idea.  I firmly believe that education should be about learning and challenging yourself versus studying to a test or memorizing answers to receive better grades.  Unfortunately I think many people, especially those from my decade, were taught this way.  We were brought up in a culture where you have to memorize only what is being taught on a test, in order to get better grades, in order to get into the best college, etc, etc.  I think how Shereef describes the "kitchen" mindset is a better way to approach learning and the educational environment.  I have high hopes that my cohort will come into this experience as a team and that we will dictate our own learning and growth.  I love the idea that we will all be in this together and we will all be eager to help each other out, teach each other new things, and inspire each other to pursue our passions.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    Second of all, I am very excited to be surrounded by people with the same passions and aspirations.  It is very tough to be in an environment where people are not interested in technology to go off and learn this material on my own.  I have also found that it isn't practical as I don't have an outlet to practice or keep up with my skills.  The same can be said for the learning and growth mindset.  I think that in the corporate world today (specifically my current company), many people have closed minds when it comes to reforming a process.  I think that most environments can be improved upon, but it requires people that are motivated to do the work.  I've found that many higher executives do not have an open mind in this regard and are not willing to think about making changes that may improve the company culture if it requires extra work to get there.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    I also want to speak to Shereef's point on the two fears that people have entering DBC.  As someone with very little programming experience before DBC, I definitely admit to having the first fear - that I am way behind everyone in the rest of my cohort.  I will give myself credit for being a fast learner though and I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can from the rest of my cohort.  I hope by the end of this process I can say that I've also been able to contribute to someone else's learning experience by teaching them something that may play to my strengths.

  <h3>Git Bloggin'</h3>
  <h4>February 25, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    As a completely new programmer myself, I am writing this blog in hopes of tracking my own thoughts as well as potentially educating others who are interested in learning about programming.  This post is my first technical blog and will cover the basics of git: version control, how git tracks changes, and the benefits of using GitHub to store code.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    First things first: what is git? Git is a tool that you can download to your computer which makes it easy to track changes to certain documents and merge changes.  It is very similar in concept to how the tracking changes functionality works in Microsoft Word.  Not only can you use it alone to track your own changes and update files, but it also allows multiple people to work on the same file and make changes which can then be merged to produce a final version. Git uses something called version control to do this - essentially it saves a separate version of a file every time you tell it to.  This can be useful if you make an error in a file and want to revert to how the file was at an earlier point in time.  The more times you save your changes, the more possibilities exist for this.  Developers use version control to be able to revert to prior code when something in the new code fails.  Oftentimes code is crucial to business operations and it is imperative to be able to revert to the tested, working code in order to get a project done.  Version control allows the developer to re-deploy the working code, and then go back and make the necessary updates to new code.
  </article>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    GitHub is an online storage system for code.  Developers use GitHub to remotely store their code, so others can access it and make changes of their own.  The benefits of this is that you can have multiple people making changes to the same document housed on GitHub and the system will keep track of these and merge them at the end to form one coherent document.  The individuals don't have to be in the same location to collaborate on a project.

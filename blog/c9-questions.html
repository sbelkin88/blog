  <h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
  <h4>April 21, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>

    One of the main things I've learned during Phase 0 has been that google is your best friend when learning to code.  I've found that I always have questions that aren't addressed in the codecademy courses or in the documentation, and it's important to be able to find those answers on google.  Outside of posting a question on stack overflow or a similar website, it's important to be able to phrase a question on a search engine to be able to get the best website answers possible.

    I think question-writing is very similar to writing/editing in general as it's best practice to make sure everything is spelled correctly, your grammar is accurate, and you're including all necessary information.  In a coding context, it's important to include what language you're working in, and possibly an example of your code (as long as you aren't posting a company's private code) so that someone can review it and see what's going on.  I think it can also be beneficial to specify what type of computer you're using, especially for help with using the terminal or installing software.

    The biggest hurdle I've had in finding an answer during Phase 0 was not knowing how to phrase a question correctly.  For example, on a recent challenge we had to create a nested for loop through an object in JavaScript, but all answers kept being about iterating through nested arrays. It was a bit frustrating trying to phrase my question specifically enough to find a good resource without typing out the exact situation.

    I think being able to ask good questions in person is just as important, if not more so, than being able to successfully find resources online.  I've found through my work experience that people's time is the most valuable resource.  An important thing to keep in mind in real-life situations is to first sit down and think about the question that you want to ask.  Have you asked this before?  Do you have any existing notes or resources you can utilize first?  If not, it's important to be as concise and clear as possible.  Start with a high level background describing the circumstance and then ask the specific question you had in mind.  If you start with the question, another person might have no clue what you're talking about and then you have to back up and give the broader overview anyways.  After you ask the question, I think it's also a good habit to write a note for yourself on what the response was so that you have something to reference later on.  You always think you'll remember the answer later, but I've found that's generally not the case.  It's better to refer to your own notes later, rather than asking the same question twice.

  <h3>Thinking Style</h3>
  <h4>March 14, 2015</h4>
  <p></p>
  <article>
    This week's cultural blog focuses on our thinking styles.  After taking the short quiz (<a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">found here</a>), I was not surprised to find that I am a concrete sequential thinker.  Some of the things concrete sequential thinkers like are order, getting something right at the first attempt, and following precise, specific directions.  I can honestly say that my personality is in-line with this description 100%.

    In some ways, my thinking style has jived very well with Phase 0 of DBC.  We have very straightforward instructions, and a logical order to complete tasks in.  However, in other ways I have had to expand my work style.  For example, one thing that is difficult for concrete sequential thinkers to do is work in groups.  DBC is all about peer learning and group work, which has been an adjustment for me.  I know that I prefer to work through problems and learn on my own and I have had to adjust my preferences in order to follow the curriculum.  I also know that I like to stay on task, which can be difficult if I'm pairing with someone who goes out of order, or can go off on a tangent.  While those discussions can sometimes be beneficial in the long run, part of me always wants to just continue with the task at hand.  I think that part of this process will be about me being flexible and open to other's insights and processes, and trying things in a different way.

    With that being said, I'm trying my best to go into this process, and time in my life, with an open mind.  I know that I wasn't happy with the way things were before, and I think changing my mindset can help with that.  I've always had a very fixed mindset (developed mainly I think from the culture I grew up in) - being afraid of failure, not taking risks, and believing that you're either the best or you're nothing.  Unfortunately I think many people my age, and from my hometown, would agree with this.  We were raised this way.  But it doesn't make it right, and I think we can all work on changing this to be better people.  By leaving my stable, well-paying job behind, and with no set future, I am taking the biggest risk I ever have, in pursuit of finding meaning in my life and in my career.  I have realized that I'm not content sitting behind a desk doing nothing with my time in order to earn a hefty salary to be able to afford nice things.  I'd rather be happy every day with less money, more knowledge, and a sense of fulfillment.

    So far in Phase 0 I am trying to catch myself whenever I fall back into a fixed mindset, and changing the way I'm viewing something.  For example, I was very nervous before the first guided pairing session.  In my mind, I didn't want to say or do something wrong because I didn't want to look stupid in front of others.  I also knew that we would be getting feedback from these sessions, and I wanted the best possible "grade".  Afterwards, I realized that I needed to take a step back from this, and understand that this is the time to take a risk and really internalize whatever feedback is given to me to improve upon myself.  I know I won't be graduating this program with a GPA tied to my name, or a class ranking, so I need to take this oppotunity to learn as much as I can, and grow as much as I can.

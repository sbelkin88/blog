<h3>Chef's Kitchen</h3>
  <h4>February 25, 2015</h4>

    This blog post will take a slightly different angle, and will cover my impressions and expectations of DBC, and go through some of my thoughts surrounding Shereef's fireside chat.

    To begin with, let's discuss DBC's culture and experience.  My impression of DBC's culture is that of fostering creativity and expression, while learning valuable skills.  One of the main reasons I chose DBC over other bootcamp-style courses was because of their learning structure.  Not to go off on a tangent about the state of this country's education system, but it needs to be reformed. I obviously don't have the qualifications to dictate how it should be done, but I think that some of the ideas and styles practiced by DBC have the right idea.  I firmly believe that education should be about learning and challenging yourself versus studying to a test or memorizing answers to receive better grades.  Unfortunately I think many people, especially those from my decade, were taught this way.  We were brought up in a culture where you have to memorize only what is being taught on a test, in order to get better grades, in order to get into the best college, etc, etc.  I think how Shereef describes the "kitchen" mindset is a better way to approach learning and the educational environment.  I have high hopes that my cohort will come into this experience as a team and that we will dictate our own learning and growth.  I love the idea that we will all be in this together and we will all be eager to help each other out, teach each other new things, and inspire each other to pursue our passions.

    Second of all, I am very excited to be surrounded by people with the same passions and aspirations.  It is very tough to be in an environment where people are not interested in technology to go off and learn this material on my own.  I have also found that it isn't practical as I don't have an outlet to practice or keep up with my skills.  The same can be said for the learning and growth mindset.  I think that in the corporate world today (specifically my current company), many people have closed minds when it comes to reforming a process.  I think that most environments can be improved upon, but it requires people that are motivated to do the work.  I've found that many higher executives do not have an open mind in this regard and are not willing to think about making changes that may improve the company culture if it requires extra work to get there.

    I also want to speak to Shereef's point on the two fears that people have entering DBC.  As someone with very little programming experience before DBC, I definitely admit to having the first fear - that I am way behind everyone in the rest of my cohort.  I will give myself credit for being a fast learner though and I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can from the rest of my cohort.  I hope by the end of this process I can say that I've also been able to contribute to someone else's learning experience by teaching them something that may play to my strengths.

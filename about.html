  <p>Hi, I'm Sam.  I recently made the transition from the financial industry to tech, and this site will follow my journey from a coding newbie to a girl writing rock-solid code.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I graduated from Colgate University in 2010 with a degree in Economics and continued on to work for an asset management company, where I've been for the past 4 1/2 years.  Recently I decided to make the switch to tech and am attending Dev Bootcamp in NYC to become a developer.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I am a lover of animals, barre class, and food, and am very close with my family.  In my spare time you can find me catching up with friends, re-reading a good book, or relaxing at home.  Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments!</p>
